## Overview

This repository contains code and data for analyzing Medicare research. The goal is to provide insights and visualizations based on Medicare data.

## Structure

The codebase is organized into the following directories:

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data files.
- `scripts/`: Includes all the scripts used for data processing and analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- `results/`: Output files such as charts, graphs, and summary tables.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pogjester/medicare-research.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

## Data Notice
The primary datasets used in this paper are the “Medicare Geographic Variation - by National, State & County” dataset from CMS, the “ACS 1-year estimates subject tables” from the U.S. Census Bureau, and the “Hospice and Palliative Care Office Visit Costs” dataset from CMS. Together, these datasets provide a view of healthcare spending, utilization, and demographics across the United States, enabling a comprehensive analysis of Medicare spending patterns and their relationship to socioeconomic factors. They were merged using a mapping of county names, resulting in a unified dataset with 2,874 county observations. **All data is for educational and research purposes and not for commercial use.
